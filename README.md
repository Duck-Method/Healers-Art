# Healers-Art
This is my first fully built website that I made before taking any classes or courses and learned everything by googling and through trial and error. This was made with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my business. 
I started with this being a Wordpress website but it was too slow to load on phones and I could not figure out why wordpress was having such a hard time with a basic static website. So I built this from scratch and deployed it over in google buckets. Navigating through Google's services was a hassle and a half but I got it running and routed my URL through correctly. 
Now I have moved everything over to GitHub pages to deploy here.
