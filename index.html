                <br><br><br><br>
                <p>My name Is Brian Baker. Since graduating from Utah College of Massage Therapy and passing the MBLEx in 2016, I have been practicing full time as an LMT. During my education, I was trained in 14 separate massage modalities ranging from Reflexology to Structural Integration, and Shiatsu to Russian Sports Massage. This gave me a wide breadth of knowledge on how to work with the musculoskeletal system. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to combine and adapt the techniques from each of the modalities and find my niche in providing a massage that focuses on gaining back the mobility lost from tight muscles, and addressing the resulting imbalances. I do this by combining Trigger Point, Structural Integration, Craniosacral, and Sports Massage techniques as an underlying knowledge base to my approach. Using those modalities as my main guide, I keep the entirety of the musculoskeletal system in mind as I identify areas of ongoing immobility so that I can attempt to address the root cause or causes. Once we begin, I continue to adapt and adjust the techniques of each tool used based upon the goals of the massage and any injuries, surgeries, or contraindications that you may have. I do this to help you receive the work, and, in working together, we get you back on your feet and out into your life with less discomfort in your movements than before you were on my table.</p>

                    <p>   Whether it was watching dancing, extreme sports, free diving, mountaineering, parkour, or the Olympics, I have always been fascinated by what the human body is capable of. During my time studying at Utah College of Massage Therapy, I was able to put that fascination into practice and deepen my understanding of the human body in ways that I had never thought possible. I learned the specifics of how a body moves and about some very common ailments that happen when a body is not allowed that movement; The ins and outs of the musculoskeletal system and the surrounding anatomy; Learning through hands-on training and application, some of the many different ways to manipulate the musculoskeletal and connective tissues of the body (modalities); Along with too many other lessons, lectures, and tidbits of knowledge to put down here. Easily one of my most rewarding and mind bending years to date.</p>
                    <p>   One of the more notable lessons imparted on me by my instructors was during a career class. We had been discussing as a class about which directions to take Massage Therapy upon graduation. Whether those directions were with well known retreat spas, high level sports teams, or hospitals needing specific types of care, nothing was off limits. This exercise was so much fun because, with the help of our instructor, this was the first time a lot of us realized the breadth of where Massage Therapy could take us. After excitedly discussing what the future could hold, our instructor asked us a simple question. “Now that you have these places you want to work at, and people you want to work with, I need to ask you something; Why would they want you?”.</p>
                    <p>   While this may have appeared as quite harsh at first, it provided a simple catalyst for introspection: ‘If everyone in this class with me was given the exact same information to work with, why would anyone want to hire me on, or come to me as a client, over any of my classmates? And not just my classmates, but anyone who has a license, or will ever have a license.’.</p>
                    <p>   With the intensity, pace, and variety of what we were learning, I could hardly do anything more than keep up; yet, my eyes were suddenly opened to the idea that just having a license isn’t enough. It can get you on someone’s radar, but if you have aspirations beyond working for a business that will accept anyone with a license, then you have to increase what you are capable of.</p>
                    <p>   After that class discussion, I thought more about the title I was striving for “Licensed. Massage. Therapist”: ‘The Licensed part is up to me passing the Utah Department of Occupational and Professional Licensing exam after I graduate. The Massage part is being taken care of by the knowledge and hands-on training provided by the school. But the Therapy part is left up to me.’ ‘The application of the different modalities I am certified in is what constitutes the Therapy.’ This idea stuck with me throughout the rest of my education and I was determined to keep exploring what that meant.</p>
                    <p>   After graduating and receiving my license, I took what I had learned from the lessons, lectures, nuggets of knowledge, and hands-on training; and applied them in as many different combinations of modalities as I could come up with to discover how I could set myself apart when it comes to that ‘Therapy’ portion. Over the next few years, working in many different types of businesses, I learned that I have an aptitude for finding the core causes of tension throughout the body. I also found that in applying the tensegral model of the muscles and connective tissues, it was more effective to work on multiple areas of the body at once; and in certain cases, combining that with specific controlled motions from the person receiving the Massage, would result in a deeper and more effective release of the locked muscles. I also discovered that my passion lies in helping people achieve tangible results when receiving Massage Therapy; and that by being included in the process they are more likely to have longer lasting results. The phrase “every body is different.” has also stayed consistently, sometimes annoyingly, true; and every time I have been arrogant enough to think that what has worked for one person will work for the next, I am humbly reminded of that phrase.</p>
                    <p>   To this day, as I adjust what I do to help the specific issues of the body in front of me, I am constantly presented with opportunities to learn from every individual that I get to work with. It amazes me that I get to assist people in relieving pain and discomfort that may have been plaguing them for years, and that I also get to teach simple and actionable changes that can help mitigate the return of these constant issues.</p>
                    <p>   Each and every person that I have had the pleasure to work with over the years has been paramount in my discovery of what ‘Therapy’ means to me as a Massage Therapist and I am happy to keep learning in small and large ways. I don’t believe that I will ever come to an end of what Massage Therapy can teach me, and I don’t think I will ever stop enjoying what I get to do.</p>
                    <p>   If you have ever received a massage and felt that the deeper persistent issues weren’t addressed, or if you are looking for results that are not only felt days later, but results that you can feel as soon as you are standing, then I am the Massage Therapist for you.</p>

                <h3 class="title" id="FAQ">FAQ</h3>
                <ul>Where is the office?</ul>
                <p class="bump">-The office is located at 9069 South 1300 West Suite D. West Jordan, UT 84088 Inside the business of Comprehensive Psychological Services</p>
                <ul>Do I have to get naked?</ul>
                <p class="bump">-NO, you don’t have to get naked at all! The type of massage therapy that I perform works much better if you are wearing clothes. No need to disrobe at all, just show up with, or wear, clothes that you would exercise in. Minus the shoes, I recommend ones that are easy to remove.</p>
                <ul>Masseuse or Massage Therapist?</ul>
                <p class="bump">-YES, it does matter. “Masseuse”, while having a long history associated with sex-work that I won’t get into here, is also not a protected title, meaning anyone can use the term without legal consequence. “Massage Therapist” on the other hand, usually shortened from Licensed Massage Therapist (L.M.T.) IS a protected title. This means that I have gone to an accredited school, studied for and passed a wide range of classes on the safety and ethics of working with the human body, as well as taken and passed the related hands-on training needed for each individual modality to graduate from the school. This qualifies me to TAKE the licensing test for Utah. Graduating does not mean I automatically get a license. Upon passing the Utah Department of Occupational and Professional Licensing exam for Massage Therapy, I am given a license number and allowed to practice professionally. You can look up anyone’s license status on dopl.utah.gov, this is publicly available information that you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for. My license number is 10036330-4701 in case you were curious. If the state of Utah finds for whatever reason that I should no longer hold a license, then I no longer have a license, which means I am not allowed to practice Massage Therapy. (This is of course glossing over the entire why and review process of getting a license revoked.) So yes, it does matter.</p>
                <ul>I do not feel comfortable showing up alone. Can I bring my significant other with me?</ul>
                <p class="bump">-Absolutely! Making sure you are safe while under my care is one of my utmost concerns and I would happily have them in the room during the entire massage to make sure you feel safe.</p>
                <ul>Can I bring my kid, dog, houseplant, favourite rug, etc. with me?</ul>
                <p class="bump">-No, I am not a babysitter, dogsitter, plant-sitter, etc. I am focusing my attention on helping YOU to receive Massage Therapy. I am sorry if this causes any inconveniences but I am only one person and I don’t have the facilities or the employees at this time to make adjustments or accommodations for these requests under ANY circumstance.</p>
                <ul>I have questions that aren’t covered here…</ul>
                <p class="bump">-Please give me a call and ask away (385) 312-0267. If I get enough of the same questions I will update the FAQ. Please understand that I may not be able to answer your call, so leave me a voicemail and I will gladly get back to you.</p>
